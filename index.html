        <h1>Supernatural Hunt</h1>
        <p class="intro">Welcome, Hunter! You are here to put your supernatural world surviving skills to test. Letâ€™s see if you can hunt at the same level with Van Helsing, John Constantine, and the Winchester brothers. On this journey, you will face several unpleasant creatures, that you would definitely not want to encounter unprepared. Once the enemy appears on the screen, in order to defeat it, you need to choose the correct weapon or method of the ones given to you to either scare off or kill the monster. However, if you use the wrong tool, the creature will strike back. I am sure you are strong enough to take one hit, but be prepared... there is only one second chance. Good luck, Hunter!
